# Technology-Mobile-Car
The automobile industry has shown many recent technological advancements, engineers are
more concern to make the automobiles efficient and more environment as well as user friendly.
Moreover considering the modern era the Mobile phones have become the indispensable part of
the life, also started to be popular in technological areas. As the generation now except all the
things they use in daily life to be automated and intelligent enough to take its own decisions. The
mobile phones are also used in the remote application by integrating it with hardware system. As
Smartphone’s and tablets became increasingly prevalent, smart car tech is becoming easier to
use. Nowadays people wonder how to control their car using smart phone.
Tech mobile car is this wonder automobile, which enables the driver to control various
functionalities through mobile phone. Moreover the perspicacious system is installed in it, which
is capable enough to take decisions on the basis of the external circumstances such as air quality,
obstacle in its perimeter, weather conditions. The chief objective behind such an initiative was to
provide a luxury feature in a lower segment motor vehicle, which usually used to come in a
premium automobile. The endeavor focused on offering cost effective solution and at the same
time providing complete driving experience to the user. The application allows the user to
completely dependent on the self-regulating system installed in the car.
# Accident Prevention
As nowadays the motor vehicles are more prone to the accidents because of the following
reasons:-
1. Over Speeding
2. Using mobile while driving
3. Parking the car in congested area
The application provide facility to user such that it reads the notifications and caller name for the
user, so that caller don’t have to see the mobile and get distracted by it. An alert is generated and
a message is send to the owner of the car if the driver has over speeded. Parking assistant system
is installed the car which transmits the distance from the obstacle in car’s perimeter to mobile
phone and application enable alert the driver by voice command if the distance between car and
obstacle is very less.
# Hazard prevention
Recently there are many incidents of CNG operated vehicles catching fire due to leakage of
CNG. A sensor integrated system is installed in car which detects any CNG leakage in the car
and automatically if there is any leakage the application which direct the driver to stop the car
immediately. Also mobile application consciously tracks the temperature of the Car engine and
do further processing on it and if the temperature exceeds particular limit it alarms to notify the
driver to further protect the car from any hazard.
# Environmental Friendly Feature
As nowadays pollution is major concern as its level is increasing day by day. Moreover motor
vehicles has more contribution towards the pollution their by degrading the environment. So
there is feature in application which fetch the pollutant content released by car and then
comparing it with different pollution level and sending the message to owner if the car is
emitting more pollutants, so that owner can have pollution check for it.
# User Friendly Features
The application has the feature to enlist all the nearby petrol pumps, restaurants, ATM’s,
hospitals on mobile phones, in case of the driver and passengers are in unknown place. The
application also enables the driver to easily navigate to a location using Navigation feature. The
android application has facility to control side mirrors and the power windows. Also the music
system can be muted or de-muted using the application.
# Heat Release System
As in summers due to green house effect the heat get trapped in the car chamber when car is
parked at place where sun rays directly enter in car. So it becomes difficult for the driver and
passengers to sit in the car. The car is equipped with the heat release system, which can be
triggered using the application from remote place before coming to car to operate it. This system
is intelligent enough to take the decision on the basis of the temperature in car. System senses the
temperature and if temperature is above the threshold level the heat release system is actified. In
this automatically the car ignition is switched on and further all the power windows are lowered
to release the heat and thereby when temperature come to stable point all the power windows are
closed and system is set to rest position.
# Car Engine Stablization System
As in diesel automobiles its necessary to energize the car engine for some time before to operate
it so as to set it to the stable condition. The installed system in car can actuate engine, which is
initiated on the command of the owner through phone from remote place.
# Vehicale Performance
An android application will store various information about the performance of the car and
further do processing on it to calculate the fuel efficiency and regularly notify the owner of the
car about the performance of the car. It include fuel efficiency feature which calculate the
efficiency of the car based on the fuel usage.
# Rain Sensing Wiper
Car is equipped with an intelligent system which decide the speed of the rain on basis of the
intensity of the Rain. Further more a application notifies the level of the water tank in car wiper
water tank.
